There are 5 common methodologies to choose from; Those being: Waterfall, Rad, Spiral, Agile and Extreme.

The topics to consider are:
  + Stakeholders
  + Feasibility, Fact Finding methods used
  + Requirements Spec
  + Design Stage
  + Testing methods and documentation
  + The 4 methods of implementation
  + User and Technical documentation

### Stakeholders

Stakeholders are anyone who is interested in the product. They would be communicated with thoroughly throughout development for any comments on how the product is currently functioning or on how it looks.

### Feasibility and Fact Finding methods

This step is researching how the code will work and how possible it will be to make in the given time period.

### Requirements Spec

This is written by the client and contains everything the product needs for it to be sold successfully.

### Design Stage

The design stage is creating an example of how the end product will look. It also involves everything that the stakeholder wants and is checked with them before starting development.

### Testing methods and documentation

Testing can be done by Stakeholders to make sure the product is working as intended. People can also be employed to test the program.

Documentation is the process of creating detailed instructions as to how the product works. There are two types of documentation: User documentation and development documentation. User documentation is for the stakeholders and development documentation is for people looking to work on the product and change the code.

### Waterfall method

The waterfall methodology has many flaws. It relies on each step being completed in order and once a step is complete, it cannot be changed. This means if a product does not meet the buyers demands then at its development-end then it has to be scrapped and restarted. You ask the buyer for the requirements once then design the product then implement, test  and deploy all without checking if any of those steps were what the buyer wanted. The buyer cannot change their mind about the product and the buyer doesn't get to check the product until it is finished. Bad.

### Rapid Application Development

A very cool methodology (you could call it rad), that gets every stage working together throughout development. The buyer (stakeholder) gives the requirements and then the project is planned. After the first prototype (of any section of the project as it is split into multiple parts) the buyer looks at the product and tells them what needs to change. After that the plan is changed and another prototype is made and repeat and so on. This keeps happening until a set time or the buyer is out of money or happy with the end product.

### Spiral

The spiral methodology is like the rad methodology except it repeats every stage sequentially and has less communication.

### Agile

Literally the exact same as rad but with a different diagram. The project is planned, designed, developed, tested, deployed and reviewed repeatedly until the product is ready for launch.

### Extreme

Sections can be repeated without going back to the very start. Programming is done in pairs too which allows for new employees to be coached.
