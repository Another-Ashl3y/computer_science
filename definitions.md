# Systems Architecture

## CPU

The CPU (Central processing unit) is the "brain" of the computer that processes all instructions and is responsible for keeping the computer running. It holds all the registers: PC, IR, CIR, MAR, MDR and the ACC. It also holds the ALU and the L1 Cache. It is connected to the control, address and data bus which connect to other hardware on the system like RAM, ROM, GPUs and Secondary Storage.

## RAM

Random-Access Memory is a volatile primary storage that stores in use programs and their data. This includes the operating system. It is the main storage that is used and is much faster than secondary storage and is also solid state which makes it more durable.

## ROM

Read-Only Memory is a type of storage device that can only be read from. It does not lose its data when without power and typically stores the Basic input/output system (BIOS) and Power-on Self-Test (POST). It can also be used to store all the instructions in embedded systems as they don't need to have instructions stored in data memory because programs generally aren't being written on

## BIOS

For the bios: Look on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS).

## ALU

The arithmatic Logic Unit (ALU) performs all mathematic and logic operations like addition, subtraction, AND, OR, NOT and shifts. The output is immediatley stored in the ACC

## PC

The program counter (PC) stores the address of the next instruction.

## CIR

The current instruction register (CIR) stores the current instruction (wow, I know).

## MAR

The memory address register (MAR) stores the address of the data being accessed.

## MDR

The memory data register (MDR) stores the data of the address being read from.

## ACC

The accumulator (ACC) stores the immediate output of the ALU.

## CU

The control unit (CU) stores the clock and manages how data is moved on the CPU.

## Control Bus

The control bus is an n-direction and connects the CPU to other hardware components to allow them to interact.

## Address Bus

The address bus is uni-directional and tells memory which address to access.

## Data Bus

The data bus is bi-directional and it holds the data being sent between the CPU and memory.

## Cache

Stores output of recently used instructions to prevent repeated re-calculation of long instructions.

## Pipelining

One instructions processing is started before the rest are finished. They get pushed through a series of processing that is placed in steps.
