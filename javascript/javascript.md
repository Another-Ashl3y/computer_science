# Javascript

Javascript is a programming language that is built into most browsers. It is paired with the scripting language HTML to create websites. Javascript being built into browsers allows for front end web-dev. Apart from its syntax being awful and having inconsistencies in `if` statements people still like it (*somehow*).

## The basics

You can create variables in javascript to store data. It is done by using the `let` keyword. The benefit of the `let` keyword is that scope is kept consistent.

```javascript
// Example
                  // v requires a semicolon like a good programming language
let a = "Hello World";    // A variable named "a" to keep other people confused storing a string type
let b = 2024;             // A variable named "b" storing an integer type
let c = 3.1415926535897;  // A variable named "c" storing a real/floating point type with the value of PI

```
