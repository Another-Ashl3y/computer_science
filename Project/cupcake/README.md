# The cupcake engine

The name for this engine is cupcake for no specific reason.
Reasons could include:

+ Every cupcake I make just falls like how almost every pixel in this engine does.
+ The use of this engine is designed to be a piece of cake or a cupcake, you could say.
+ I like cupcakes and it was a wholesome name.
+ It was the best random thought that came into my head.

Take your pick of which one it is.
